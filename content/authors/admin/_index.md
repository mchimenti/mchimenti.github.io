Hello! I am a research scientist with 20 years of deep experience in the fields of bioinformatics, genomics, and structural biology. I thrive when working on multi-disciplinary projects that combine genomics and computational (ML/AI) approaches to explore and solve complex scientific questions.  

I received world-class PhD training in biophysics, made the leap to computational chemistry to work on drug discovery as a postdoc, and now work as a computational biologist and data scientist. 

**Mission**

I aim to accelerate biomedical discovery through the application of cutting-edge computational methods and data visualization. My focus is on leveraging my experience in genomic data analysis to enable better decision-making in both research and clinical settings.

**Leadership** 

As Director of the Bioinformatics Division at IIHG and Senior Scientific Advisor for FBB-Biomed, I lead cross-functional teams in indentifying and applying innovative bioinformatic solutions for complex biological problems.  My proven track record includes over 60 scientific publications in top journals, accumulating more than 3000 total citations (h-index, 19).

I am also a Co-founder of the **UI Spatial Transcriptomics Consortium** and Co-Director of the **Hawk-IDDRC Developmental Genomics Core**.

**Consulting**

I help early-stage "startup" biotech companies working in the genomics and diagnostics space organize, analyze and interpret their genomic sequencing and assay data.  I have 2+ years of experience consulting in this space.  Along the way I have helped my clients file 2 major provisional patents creating significant value for founders and investors.
